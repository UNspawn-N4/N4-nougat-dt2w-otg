Tested on LG Nexus 4 (mako):

AOSP: Nitrogen OS Android-Version 7.1.2
CM: LineageOS-14.1 Android-Version 7.1.2

maybe also working with other ROMs

dt2w enable in rootshell:
echo 1 > /sys/devices/virtual/input/lge_touch/dt_wake_enabled
or from app, e.g. kerneladjutor ...

USB OTG:
ID pin detection is unused in Nexus 4. Instead, detection of a "proprietary" charger (voltage on the data pins) is used to determine host mode. Self-powered devices don't send power to the phone. This will cause the device not being detectable. External power is always required.


Build:

./clone-dependencies.sh
./build.sh
